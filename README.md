#Investigate a Relational Database  - Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree 


This is the final project of the “Introduction to SQL” module.

The Sakila Database is a fictitious DVD rentals database consisting in 15 tables. Our job was to get business insights by accessing the data with SQL and elaborate a small presentation after. 

There are three archives in the repository: 
<ul>Dvd-rental-erd-2. PNG file containing Sakila’s Entity Relationship Diagram. A map  to understand the database.</ul>

<ul>Daniel Alonso Queries.  TXT file containing 5 SQL queries. Those are the queries we used to retrieve information for the following presentation</ul>
<ul>SQL Project Submission Template. PDF containing 4 Powerpoint slides. There we presented the insights that we could get after retrieving the preview data.</ul>


I strongly suggest opening first the PDF to familiarize yourself with the results and then open the txt file to see the queries.
